This module contains the sources to build a Docker container with Hawkular Services.

== Cassandra

Hawkular Services requires a running Cassandra instance with RPC enabled.  If you don't have an existing
Cassandra instance, you can start one using Docker.

  docker run --name hawkular-cassandra -e CASSANDRA_START_RPC=true -d cassandra:3.0.9

This command should return the id of the running container.  You can also verify that it is running
by using the "docker ps" command.

  docker ps

== Building Hawkular Services

The docker-maven-plugin can be used to create a Dockerfile, and add the docker image to the local registry.

  mvn docker:build

By default, this will create a docker image with the name "<username>/hawkular-services".

  docker images

== Running Hawkular Services

Next, start up the hawkular services container and point it to the Cassandra instance.

  docker run --link=hawkular-cassandra -e CASSANDRA_NODES=hawkular-cassandra -p 8080:8080 `whoami`/hawkular-services

=== Using SSL

If you want to use Hawkular Services with SSL try this command:

  docker run --link=hawkular-cassandra -e CASSANDRA_NODES=hawkular-cassandra -e HAWKULAR_HOSTNAME=hawkular -e HAWKULAR_USE_SSL=true -p 8443:8443 `whoami`/hawkular-services

This will generate a public and private certificate for you using the domain name `hawkular`
(from the environment `HAWKULAR_HOSTNAME`).

You can also provide the private and public key in PEM format mounting the files `/client-secrets/hawkular-services-private.key`
and `/client-secrets/hawkular-services-public.pem`. If you don't provide any, they will be autogenerated and the
public key in PEM format will be put on `/client-secrets/hawkular-services-public.pem`.
